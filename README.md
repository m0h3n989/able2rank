**Facebook Metrics (FB):**
The data is related to posts published during the year of 2014 on the Facebook page of a renowned cosmetics brand \cite{uci_repo,fb_data}. Each post is described in terms of 18 numeric, binary, and nominal features (e.g., type, category, month, weekday, hour, like, comment, share, total interactions). We removed those entries with missing values, and used the data from the first (FB1, 77 posts) and second quarter (FB2, 113 posts) of the year for training and testing. Rankings were defined based on the total interaction of each post (ignoring ties).
